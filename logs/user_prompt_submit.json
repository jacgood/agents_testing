Analzye the sub-agents and create a CLAUDE.md file that as we develop a project, you will utilize the sub-agents for the planning, developing, testing, and deploying of the project. I want to be able to talk with you, Claude, about what I would like and you delegate the work to the sub-agents. You will be the manager of all of the sub-agents and be responsibile for properly utilizing them on this project. Think hard about this."
